# Weedware License

This is a website for the Weedware License I have invented after reading
yet another stupid conversation about software licensing on local user
group's IRC channel. Here's the full content of the license:

    Weedware License rev. 126
    
    I&I Chris Kowalik <chris@nu7hat.ch> hereby grant you with the
    license to use this work in any way you want as far as your usage
    is not related to war, brutality or any other kind of crime or evil.
    By using this work you agree to disseminate freedom and peace on
    our beautiful world.
    
    Also if we meet someday and you consider this work to be useful for
    you, you can invite us to chill with a pipe of peace in return.

Use it and enjoy the software as well as weed :).
